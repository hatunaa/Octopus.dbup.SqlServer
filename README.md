We originally forked `dbup-sqlserver` so that we could use `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` package rather than `System.Data.SqlClient` package.

The [upstream repo](https://github.com/DbUp/dbup-sqlserver) now uses the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` package, so we no longer require this fork.

If you were relying on this, please upgrade to the official [`dbup-sqlserver` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dbup-sqlserver).
